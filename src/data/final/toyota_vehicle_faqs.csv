How often should I check my vehicle’s tire pressure?,"Toyota recommends checking the tire pressure at least once per month, as tires do seep a small amount of air. It is likely you will have to adjust the pressure regularly due to air permeation (seepage) and ambient air temperature fluctuation."
Why is my vehicle not getting the EPA-estimated fuel economy?,"The purpose of EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings is to help consumers cross-shop between vehicles. They are not intended to be predictors of fuel economy because fuel efficiency is influenced by many variables including, but not limited to, driving style, tire pressure, vehicle maintenance, load carried in the vehicle, quality and octane level of gasoline, fuel additives or seasonal variations in fuel, terrain, locale (urban/suburban) and weather conditions.
Common causes of lower fuel economy include short distance driving, frequent stops, heavy accelerations, low tire pressure, neglected vehicle maintenance and carrying heavy loads."

Why does my vehicle seem to perform differently when it is cold compared to when it is warm?,"Toyota vehicles incorporate a sophisticated emissions system that works with the Engine Control Module to warm the engine as quickly as possible by running it at high revolutions per minute (RPM) at idle, and by delaying upshifting on vehicles with an automatic transmission. Delaying upshifts keeps the cold engine's RPM higher while driving.
Emissions are highest when the engine is cold because the catalytic converter needs to be at a high operating temperature in order to function effectively. To get the engine and emissions system warmed as quickly as possible, the fast engine RPM at idle and delayed upshift continue until optimum operating temperature is reached.
Normal idle speed and automatic transmission shifting return when the engine and emissions systems are warmed to operating temperature."

"What are the ""S"" and ""B"" gear shift positions used for?","""S"" is for sport. If you're driving on twisty country roads and want to keep the RPM up as you wind through corners, the ""S"" position is where you want to be. In ""S"", the transmission holds lower gears longer for more power as you come out of the curves.

The ""B"" position favors lower gears, too, but for a totally different purpose. Just as you might shift a conventional transmission to Low on a long downhill grade; you can shift into the ""B"" position to increase engine drag and help slow the Corolla while coasting down a hill.

How do I operate the On-Demand 4 Wheel Drive in my vehicle?,"If your vehicle is equipped with 4WDemand Part-time 4WD, you'll probably want to leave the control switch in 2-wheel drive or 2WD for most situations.
For slippery conditions and light off-road driving, you may need to shift into 4-wheel high or 4H for added traction.
To do that, first slow down to less than 62 miles per hour, then turn the knob to 4H. If it's colder than 5 degrees Fahrenheit outside, you'll have to slow to less than 43 miles per hour to make the change.
In any case, you'll see the 4HI indicator appear in the instrument display.
If it flashes, 4HI hasn't locked in yet. To help it, continue to drive straight ahead then accelerate and decelerate until the system is engaged.
For more challenging off road driving or for getting around in deep sand or snow, you may need to shift to 4-wheel low or 4L.
To do that, stop the vehicle completely and keep your foot on the brake. Shift the transmission into Neutral. Push the 4WDemand knob in and turn it to 4L. Both the 4 LO and VSC OFF indicators will appear in the instrument panel.
To shift back to 4H or 2WD just reverse the process.

How can I properly prepare my vehicle for the cold winter months?,"Toyota vehicles are designed to operate in a variety of temperatures. If you reside in a cold area, the following tips may help in preparing for the winter months:
Properly wash and wax your vehicle before the severe winter weather months. This will help snow, ice, slush and mud from sticking to the vehicle surface. Try to keep the vehicle washed and waxed during the winter. When possible, use a high pressure wash to remove ice, mud and debris that form on the underside of the vehicle. Also, wash the wheels regularly to help prevent corrosion.
Inspect the windshield for chips. If there are chips or small cracks in the glass, have them repaired by your Toyota dealership or a windshield specialist. This may prevent a larger crack from forming during winter month temperature changes, or when the defroster blows warm air onto the cold glass.
Check the tire air pressure. Tire pressure runs lower when the tires are cold but will increase as the vehicle is being driven and the tires warm up. Your Toyota dealership can assist with adjusting the tire pressure for seasonal differences.
Check the tire condition (including the spare) and replace the tires if needed. In some climates or driving conditions, switching to winter tires may be beneficial.
Have the battery checked. If the battery is weak, it may not start the engine during very cold weather. Ensure the battery posts and connections are clean and free of corrosion.
Check the fluids, belts and hoses. Replace as recommended or needed. Ensure that all of the fluids are designed for cold weather use.
Check the wiper blades. Replace if needed. When possible, avoid using the wipers if there is ice or snow build up on them. Before you begin driving, brush away any heavy snow and gently lift the blades to be sure they aren't frozen to the windshield.
If you have a four wheel drive vehicle, ensure the systems are working properly and have a good understanding of how to use them if needed.
Park in a garage if possible. Before parking, brush any snow or ice off the vehicle to prevent water puddles on the garage floor. When starting a vehicle in a garage, ensure that the garage door is open and the area is well ventilated.
Do not use the parking brake when there is the potential for it to freeze. When snow or water accumulates around the parking brake mechanism it may freeze and be difficult to release.
Use the vehicle's air conditioner on an occasional basis. This will circulate the air conditioner fluid which helps keep the system hoses and seals lubricated and leak free. On most vehicles, use of the front defroster will accomplish this.
If you are driving in an area where tire chains are required, know which wheels to put them on and practice installing them before they are needed.
You may want to carry emergency supplies such as a window scraper, traction mats or sand, a small shovel, jumper cables, gloves, a hat, a blanket, a flashlight, flares, a first aid kit and a cell phone with a charger and emergency contact numbers."
Can a conventional hybrid vehicle run on electricity when it runs out of fuel?,"No. Though a hybrid vehicle can operate in electric-only mode when gasoline is in the tank, it is not designed to run without gasoline. Doing so could cause severe damage to the hybrid system, so drivers should be sure to keep gas in the tank at all times."

    Vehicle Stability Control is an electronic system designed to help the driver maintain vehicle control under adverse conditions. It is not a substitute for safe and attentive driving practices. Factors including speed, road conditions, weather and driver steering input can all affect whether VSC will be effective in preventing a loss of control. See Owner's Manual for additional limitations and details.
  Brake Assist is designed to help the driver take full advantage of the benefits of ABS. It is not a substitute for safe driving practices. Braking effectiveness also depends on proper vehicle maintenance, tire and road conditions. See Owner’s Manual for additional limitations and details.

Smart Stop Technology operates only in the event of certain contemporaneous brake and accelerator pedal applications. When engaged, the system will reduce power to help the brakes bring the vehicle to a stop. Factors including speed, road conditions and driver input can all impact stopping distance. Smart Stop Technology is not a substitute for safe and attentive driving and does not guarantee instant stopping. See Owner's Manual for additional limitations and details.

All the airbag systems are Supplemental Restraint Systems. All airbags (if installed) are designed to inflate only under certain conditions and in certain types of severe collisions. To decrease the risk of injury from an inflating airbag, always wear seatbelts and sit upright in the middle of the seat as far back as possible. Do not put objects in front of an airbag or around the seatback. Do not use a rearward-facing child seat in any front passenger seat. See Owner’s Manual for additional limitations and details."
